# 🔒 Security Policy - Quantum Falcon Cockpit

## Overview

Security is our top priority. This document outlines our security practices and how we protect sensitive information, particularly license keys and authentication data.

---

## 🚨 Critical Security Principles

### Master Key Protection

**The master key is NEVER stored in this repository.**

- Master key location: LicenseAuthority repository (private, secure)
- Access: Backend server only (environment variable)
- Client-side: NO access to master key
- Verification: All license checks happen server-side

### What IS in This Repository

✅ License verification client code  
✅ Encrypted storage mechanisms  
✅ UI components for license entry  
✅ API endpoint configuration (URL only)

### What IS NOT in This Repository

❌ Master key  
❌ Private keys  
❌ Database credentials  
❌ API secrets  
❌ User license keys  

---

## 🔐 License Authentication Security

### Architecture

```
Client (Quantum Falcon)
    ↓ [License Key]
Secure API Endpoint
    ↓ [Verification Request]
Backend Server (has master key)
    ↓ [Database Query]
License Database
    ↓ [Valid/Invalid Response]
Client (Store Encrypted Result)
```

### Key Security Features

1. **HTTPS Only**: All API communication encrypted in transit
2. **Server-Side Validation**: Master key never leaves secure server
3. **Encrypted Storage**: License data encrypted with `btoa()` before localStorage
4. **Expiration Checks**: Automatic validation of license expiration
5. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint limits verification attempts
6. **Session Timeout**: Auto-logout after inactivity

## 🛡️ Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

| Data Type | Storage Location | Encryption | Access |
|-----------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Master Key | Backend server only | Environment variable | Server only |
| User License | Encrypted localStorage | Base64 + AES | User device |
| User ID | Encrypted localStorage | Base64 | User device |
| Session Token | Memory only | N/A | Current session |

### What We Store Locally

- Encrypted license key (for offline verification)
- User tier level (free/pro/elite/lifetime)
- Expiration timestamp
- Feature flags
- User ID (anonymized)

### What We DON'T Store Locally

- Master key
- Payment information
- Personal identification data
- Plain-text credentials

---

## 🔒 Environment Variables

### Required Variables

```bash
VITE_LICENSE_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-secure-api.com/api/verify
VITE_PURCHASE_URL=https://github.com/mhamp1/LicenseAuthority
```

### Backend Server Variables (NOT in this repo)

```bash
MASTER_KEY=XoYgqu2wJYVZVg5AdWO9NqhKM52qXQ_ob9oeWMVeYhw=
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
API_SECRET=...
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Backend environment variables must NEVER be committed to this repository.
