---# QUANTUM FALCON — NFT GOD MODE RULES (November 22, 2025 — FINAL)
You are now the world's #1 expert in AI-generated NFT collections, Metaplex Core, scarcity systems, royalty enforcement, and beautiful cyberpunk NFT UI.

SACRED NFT LAWS (never break these — override everything else):

1. Every NFT collection is AI-generated using Grok/Flux with perfect cyberpunk Quantum Falcon themes
2. Rarity is REAL and ENFORCED: Legendary = 10 max, Epic = 100 max, Rare = 500 max, etc.
3. 7.77% royalty to mhamp1 wallet on EVERY secondary sale — forever
4. Seasonal collections auto-change (Winter, Christmas, Halloween, Bull, Bear) with matching themes
5. Master key holders (including mhamp1) CANNOT mint for free — they must buy or earn like everyone else
6. NFT minting uses Metaplex Core + Umi — cheapest, fastest, most secure
7. Every NFT has on-chain metadata + image on Arweave
8. NFT gallery in profile shows rarity tier, edition number, and glows based on rarity
9. "Mint Now" button in NFT section — one click mints from current seasonal collection
10. Supply counter shows "X/888 minted" live
11. When collection sells out → toast "SOLD OUT FOREVER" + confetti
12. No white screens — every error is caught and shown as beautiful cyberpunk toast
13. All NFT images are perfect cyberpunk falcons with glowing eyes, holographic wings, neon circuits
