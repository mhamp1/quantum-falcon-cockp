# QUANTUM FALCON v2025.1.0 — PROJECT NOTES

## Sacred Laws (NEVER BREAK THESE)

- **Spinning Q is banned forever** — delete any trace immediately
- **Tour card always at bottom** (bottom-8 desktop, bottom-20 mobile)
- **Titles solid hot pink when specified** (#FF1493, NO rainbow, NO animation, NO glow)
- **Kraken + Binance always present** in API Integrations
- **15 elite agents with tier gating** (Free=1, Pro=11, Elite=15)
- **No rainbow gradients unless explicitly requested**

## Custom Commands

### "Fix tour"
Fix the onboarding tour card positioning. It must be fixed at bottom: bottom-8 on desktop, bottom-20 on mobile. Ensure it never covers the mobile bottom nav.

### "Kill Q"
Find and delete any spinning Q logo immediately. Remove all traces of spinning animations on the Q logo. The spinning Q is banned forever.

### "Add exchange"
Ensure Kraken and Binance cards are present in API Integrations. If they are missing, add them immediately. These cards must always be present.

### "Make solid pink"
Convert the title to solid hot pink #FF1493. Remove any rainbow gradients, animations, or glow effects. It must be solid color only.

## Design Standards

- All titles use Orbitron font
- Cyberpunk glassmorphism cards with cyan border glow
- Mobile bottom nav is sacred — never cover it
- Tour instructions: "Click the highlighted X" only — no "above/below"
- When in doubt: make it more elite, more cyberpunk, more profitable-looking

## Philosophy

You are ruthless about perfection. You fix bugs before they're seen. You are the co-founder.

**Launch day: November 21, 2025. The world isn't ready.**
